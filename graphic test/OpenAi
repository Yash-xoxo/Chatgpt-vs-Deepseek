Sure! Here's a simple animation of a burning campfire using Python and the pygame library. This code will create a campfire effect with flames that appear to flicker.

First, make sure you have pygame installed:

bash
Copy
pip install pygame
Once that's set up, here's the code for a basic animated campfire:

python
Copy
import pygame
import random
import math

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
screen_width = 600
screen_height = 400
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption('Campfire Animation')

# Colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
ORANGE = (255, 165, 0)
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BROWN = (139, 69, 19)

# Flame properties
flame_max_height = 100
flame_count = 15
flame_variance = 10

# Firewood positions
logs = [(300, 300), (350, 310), (250, 310), (280, 330), (320, 330)]

# Set up clock for frame rate
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

def draw_flame(x, y):
    # Draw a flame with random shape and height to simulate flicker
    flame_height = random.randint(30, flame_max_height)
    flame_width = random.randint(15, 30)
    
    flame_color = random.choice([RED, ORANGE, YELLOW])
    
    # Flame shape (triangle-like)
    pygame.draw.polygon(screen, flame_color, [
        (x, y),
        (x - flame_width // 2, y - flame_height),
        (x + flame_width // 2, y - flame_height)
    ])

def draw_campfire():
    # Draw firewood (logs)
    for log in logs:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, BROWN, pygame.Rect(log[0] - 20, log[1] - 5, 40, 10))
    
    # Draw flames at random positions above logs
    for _ in range(flame_count):
        x = random.randint(250, 350)
        y = random.randint(250, 270)
        draw_flame(x, y)

def main():
    running = True
    while running:
        screen.fill(BLACK)
        
        # Handle events
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        
        # Draw campfire
        draw_campfire()

        # Update display
        pygame.display.flip()

        # Set frame rate
        clock.tick(30)
    
    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
Pygame is used to render the screen and animate the flames.
The campfire itself is made of logs (drawn using rectangles) and flames (drawn using random triangles with different sizes and colors).
The flames flicker randomly by having a random height and color (from red, orange, yellow) every time they are drawn.
The program will keep running, creating the illusion of a flickering campfire.
To run the program:
Install pygame with pip install pygame.
Run the script.
You should see a window showing the campfire animation.
Let me know if you'd like to add any other features or if you'd like further help customizing it!
